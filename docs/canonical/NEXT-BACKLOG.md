# Next Backlog

- Visual smoke bằng browser cho Admin command center và Customer journey.
- E2E notification deep-link và payout verification.
- Additive migration khi baseline chuyển sang DB giữ dữ liệu.
- Đo first-load thực tế trước khi tách thêm AntD/shared chunks.

## Post-closure verification

1. Run a fresh production build and record Admin route closures plus MBN initial JS/CSS after active-panel and route-style ownership changes.
2. Continue owner-level Admin route closure reduction; the initial graph is under budget, but heavy route closures still exceed 650 KB.
3. Reduce the MBN initial CSS payload after the route-owned CSS split; JS initial is measured under 650 KB, CSS remains heavy.
4. Run Admin and MBN multi-viewport visual regression gates and retain screenshots as release artifacts.
5. Run `composer release:all`, finalize hash-matched evidence, then regenerate release artifacts from the finalized HEAD.

## Sau vòng route/CSS closure

1. Chạy Admin và MBN `build:analyze` để ghi số đo mới sau route owner/CSS owner split.
2. Chạy `composer release:all` từ fresh DB với browser credentials và LibreOffice.
3. Finalize evidence chỉ từ release summary có hash khớp ba HEAD đã push.
4. Chỉ tối ưu tiếp owner nào còn vượt budget theo bundle report mới; không khôi phục shared AntD vendor.

## Required verification after 2026-08-05 owner split

1. Run Admin and MBN dependency install, lint and `build:analyze` in the supported Node runtime; record fresh initial and route-closure sizes.
2. Run Admin/MBN visual regression at desktop, tablet and mobile widths after the route/CSS split.
3. Run API targeted/full tests even though API runtime is unchanged, because release evidence must represent one synchronized three-repo source set.
4. Commit and push all three repositories, run `composer release:all`, finalize only a hash-matched passed summary, then package directly from the finalized clean HEADs.
5. Continue splitting only when the fresh bundle report identifies a real route/global dependency owner; do not create cosmetic files or reintroduce shared AntD vendor chunks.

## MBN CSS consolidation backlog

1. Reduce the remaining style-file count by merging overlapping semantic owners into shell, route, component and form ownership groups.
2. Keep legacy `vXX`/`mbn-vXX` class and token names blocked by `npm run audit:styles`; any required compatibility must use semantic aliases instead.
3. Keep `src/index.css` and `src/styles/app.css` as import-only manifests; do not reintroduce CSS side-effect imports in route or component chunks.
4. Track `npm run audit:styles` before each package handoff until the style file count and version-token count trend down.
5. Prioritize MBN CSS payload reduction from the current heavy production CSS output before adding new visual features.

# Release Follow-up — 2026-08-04

## Scope

- Giữ mô hình Mini bounded: một admin, nhiều khách hàng.
- Không thêm RBAC, company, department, HR, accounting, project hoặc report runtime.
- Contract vẫn tương thích `2026-08-04.1`; bổ sung `lifecycle.guidance` là field mở rộng.

## Source changes

- Admin không còn ép toàn bộ `antd/**` vào một `antd-core` dùng chung; Rollup có thể giữ component chỉ dùng ở route lazy trong route chunk.
- Bundle analyzer đọc Vite manifest để đo initial JS/CSS closure, không chỉ nhìn chunk lớn nhất.
- API lifecycle trả guidance về khoản cần thanh toán, hạn bàn giao, tiền thuê/cọc/khấu trừ/hoàn lại và trạng thái tranh chấp.
- Document template đã dùng không thể tạo nhánh version từ mẫu cũ khi đã có successor.
- Admin document smoke có mutation thật để xác nhận version tăng và `supersedes_template_id`.
- MBN purchase detail dùng payment timeline owner riêng; hai stylesheet presentation lớn đã thành import-only manifests.
- Release runner ghi step hiện tại, log lỗi và JSON summary.

## Verification status

Runtime verification đã chạy lại trên working tree sau follow-up:

- API full PHPUnit: pass `116 tests / 1042 assertions`.
- API Pint và maintainability guard: pass.
- Admin `check:all`: pass.
- Admin `build:analyze`: pass, có cảnh báo budget thật `initial JS 1388.9 KB`, largest bundled vendor asset `1083.2 KB`.
- MBN build, lint, release readiness và API contract: pass.
- Marketplace contract JSON đồng bộ SHA-256 trên API/Admin/MBN.
- DOCX structural integrity: pass.

Browser smoke/E2E mutation vẫn là gate riêng trước merge/tag chính thức nếu cần chứng thực runtime qua UI thật.


## All-tasks closure follow-up

- Admin defers transaction, payout and document-template modal/editor owners with `React.lazy`; the document list no longer imports `BaseForm`/`BaseModal` eagerly.
- Admin bundle analysis now writes `dist/bundle-report.json`, measures initial and lazy-route closures, and release mode fails over budget unless an explicit bundle waiver is recorded.
- API adds customer-isolation regression coverage for wallet and generated documents, plus shared rental money/deadline guidance checks for Admin and customer surfaces.
- MBN purchase policy no longer hard-codes refund percentages or deadlines that are not owned by the transaction contract.
- React/AntD warning guards prevent deprecated `Space direction`, `Alert message`, and index-based table keys from returning.
- Runtime build/PHPUnit/browser results must be regenerated after these workspace changes; previous accepted evidence remains historical only.

## Closure update - 2026-08-04 (initial closure, responsive browser and payout isolation)

- Admin shell and login are now lazy entry owners; AntD icons and rc packages are no longer forced into shared manual chunks. Fresh `build:analyze` measured initial JS at `1388.9 KB`, still over budget but improved from the previous `1463.9 KB`.
- MBN browser core now runs desktop, tablet and mobile layout checks and fails on horizontal overflow for product detail, purchase list and account profile.
- Customer payout isolation is covered: another customer cannot see or cancel a withdrawal outside their scope.
- MBN payout state presentation now distinguishes submitted/held, approved, paid, rejected and customer-cancelled money states.
- `composer release:all` requires DOCX render output by default and records actual Git HEAD values when executed inside real repositories.
- Commit/push hashes remain pending until these ZIP contents are applied to the three connected Git repositories and pushed successfully.

## Final closure follow-up

- Admin bootstrap imports `ConfigProvider` from the direct AntD subpath and no longer mounts the unused AntD `App` provider. This is intended to reduce the actual initial dependency graph, not merely rename chunks.
- `composer release:all` now requires clean, pushed source repositories by default and records the exact pre-release Git commits.
- `composer release:finalize-evidence` updates all three baseline evidence files only after those source commits are clean and synchronized with their upstream branches. The evidence update must then be committed and pushed separately.
- Build, PHPUnit, source guards, MBN build/checks and Admin bundle measurement were regenerated after these source changes. Browser smoke, transactional E2E and DOCX visual render still require the full release environment.

## Evidence correction - 2026-08-04

- Customer payout isolation regression is included in the full API suite and passed with 116 tests / 1033 assertions.
- API release package guard now catches untracked `.phpunit.result.cache`; release runner deletes PHPUnit cache after the test step, also from trap cleanup on failure, and excludes it from packaged artifacts.

## Remaining-tasks closure update - 2026-08-04

- Admin moved `ConfigProvider`, Vietnamese locale and static message holder out of `main.jsx` into `AdminThemeProvider`, imported only by lazy `Login` and `AdminLayout` owners. Fresh `build:analyze` passes with budget warnings and measures initial JS at `1388.5 KB`, so this is a valid source cleanup but not a meaningful bundle-size closure.
- `release-all.sh` now writes a structured summary containing each runtime gate and the exact pre-release Git hashes.
- `finalize-release-evidence.php` only promotes browser, transactional and DOCX evidence when the release summary is `passed` and all three summary hashes match the current pushed HEAD values. It refuses stale summaries.
- Browser smoke, transactional E2E and DOCX visual render remain pending until `release-all.sh` runs in a release environment with browser credentials and `soffice`.

## Route-local AntD vendor correction

- Phát hiện `manualChunks` vẫn đẩy AntD, `@ant-design/*` và `rc-*` vào nhánh `vendor` chung dù các chunk tên `antd-*` đã bị loại bỏ.
- Cấu hình mới trả `undefined` cho ba nhóm dependency này trước nhánh vendor tổng quát, để Rollup giữ dependency chỉ dùng ở route lazy trong route owner tương ứng.
- Fresh `npm run build:analyze` đo lại initial JS còn `290 KB` thay vì `1388.5 KB`; initial closure đã dưới budget `650 KB`.
- Route closures vẫn vượt budget, lớn nhất hiện khoảng `1409.4 KB`, vì AntD/rc đã chuyển đúng về route owner. Debt tiếp theo là tách các owner nặng như transaction detail, notification và operation control, không gom lại shared vendor.

## Route-owner follow-up — 2026-08-04

The accepted initial-load measurement remains 290 KB JS / 24.1 KB CSS. Route closure measurements from the previous build are now historical and must be rebuilt after these source changes:

- Login no longer imports the full `BaseForm`; `AuthLoginForm` owns only Form, Input and BaseButton.
- Transaction Detail defers payment, document, timeline and admin-action panels.
- Notifications defer the detail drawer until a record is opened.
- Operations Control defers tab owners and operational modals until selected.

Release evidence must not reuse the previous route-closure values. Run `npm run build:analyze` and record fresh route closures before finalizing evidence.

## Admin UI runtime closure from browser evidence

- Fixed the shared `BaseForm` schema grid to use real CSS-grid column ownership instead of AntD row/span width calculations that collapsed fields into narrow vertical columns.
- `BaseFilter` now searches automatically on select/date changes and debounces text input; the search button remains as an explicit fallback.
- Product approval, payment review, wallet-deposit reconciliation, payout decisions and dispute resolution now follow one review pattern: approve requires confirmation, reject opens a BaseForm modal and requires a concrete reason.
- Audit logs and generated documents now use shared list/page/filter owners, while raw marketplace values are mapped through canonical labels.
- Action Center and Marketplace Operations statistics use responsive grids instead of one-card-per-row layouts.
- Demo fixtures now cover wallets/cash-flow, trust/risk/content, marketplace reviews and issued documents for browser verification.
- These changes are source-verified. Browser UI, full seed/runtime tests, lint and production build must be rerun after applying this source.


## Admin base UI consistency follow-up

- BaseForm now maps legacy `span: 4/6/8/12/24` to semantic 12-column widths so small legacy spans cannot collapse labels and controls into unusable narrow columns.
- BaseFilter now owns a responsive CSS Grid with change-driven search; it no longer depends on fixed AntD Row/Col sizing.
- Audit logs and generated documents use the shared BaseListView shell without a fixed action column that forces unnecessary horizontal clipping.
- Audit event/type/entity presentation now uses the canonical marketplace label owner; the MBN customer label owner was synchronized for the same shared values.
- Existing wallet, payout, trust/risk and generated-document demo fixtures remain the canonical browser-test data owners.

## Admin UI runtime verification - 2026-08-04

- Admin format, lint, check-all and build analyze pass after BaseForm/BaseFilter/review-action cleanup.
- Local browser CRUD smoke passed login, Product/Transaction/Customer forms, BaseForm relation fields, document-template create modal and payout lifecycle actions. Document-template edit modal/API version mutation is strict in release mode and needs a fresh seeded fixture for a non-skip browser mutation run.
- The document-template edit modal smoke may skip only in manual mode; release mode now requires a fresh seeded issued template and fails if the immutable-version mutation does not run.
- Fresh build keeps initial JS at `290.5 KB` / CSS `25.6 KB`; route closures remain over budget and must be split by owner, not by shared vendor.

## Fresh-seed document-template browser gate closure

- `release:all` now runs Admin CRUD smoke with `ADMIN_E2E_REQUIRE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_MUTATION=1`.
- A fresh demo seed must expose at least one published template with generated documents.
- The browser gate must open the matching row, create the successor version, and verify `supersedes_template_id`; missing fixture/action/mutation now fails release instead of silently skipping.



## Strict document-template browser gate verification

- API fresh seed fixture contract now passes in the full PHPUnit suite with `116 tests / 1042 assertions`.
- Admin release runner enforces `ADMIN_E2E_REQUIRE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_MUTATION=1`; manual smoke may still skip only outside release mode.
- Browser document-template mutation remains pending until `release:all` runs against a fresh seeded database and promotes the hash-matched release summary.


## Route, visual and dependency closure follow-up

- Admin transaction detail now mounts only the active payment/document/timeline/admin panel.
- MBN theme/application shell is lazy-owned; account and page CSS are loaded by route owners instead of the global entry manifest.
- Axios security floor is raised to 1.19.0 and form-data to 4.0.6; npm audit is a formal release gate.
- Admin and MBN visual regression runners capture desktop/tablet/mobile screenshots and fail on horizontal overflow or compressed form controls.
- Previous bundle measurements remain historical until a fresh build after these source changes.

## Dependency and bundle verification update

- Admin and MBN use `react-router` 8.3.0 directly instead of `react-router-dom`; `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` now reports zero vulnerabilities in both frontend repos.
- API full PHPUnit now passes with `117 tests / 1043 assertions`, including the isolated avatar upload limiter regression.
- Fresh Admin `build:analyze` measures initial closure at `292.0 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS`; route closures remain over budget and must be handled by owner-level splitting.
- Fresh MBN `build:analyze` measures initial closure at `448.8 KB JS / 269.7 KB CSS`; the CSS payload remains the next frontend debt after route-owned CSS movement.
- Browser runtime was rerun locally on fresh seed: MBN core/visual passed avatar upload, logout and avatar persistence after re-login; Admin strict CRUD passed document-template immutable version mutation; Admin visual passed desktop/tablet/mobile route checks.
- Full `release:all` hash-finalized summary still requires a clean committed and pushed source cycle.
- Evidence fields now distinguish independent browser/DOCX runtime passes from the pending hash-matched `release:all` summary; pending transactional API and payout-modal entries remain pending until that release cycle reruns them.

## Route closure, initial CSS and Sass module follow-up

Source state after the latest optimization:

- Admin Reconciliation is split into demand-loaded Summary and Export workspaces.
- Admin Transaction Detail loads the command center and detail sections as lazy route owners; individual payment, document, timeline and admin panels remain active-panel owners.
- Notification detail keeps BaseDrawer but no longer loads AntD Descriptions, Timeline, Tag or Input presentation modules.
- MBN account/profile/document/mobile table styles moved from the global manifest to AccountRouteShell.
- Home and catalog/detail mobile styles are owned by their respective routes.
- Sass manifest files now use `@forward`; no `.scss` file may reintroduce deprecated Sass `@import`.
- Previous Admin route-closure and MBN initial-CSS measurements are historical. A fresh `build:analyze` is required.
- Browser, transactional E2E, DOCX and release evidence must be regenerated from clean pushed source through `composer release:all`.

## Fresh route/CSS measurement after latest source update

- API release-package guard, maintainability guard, Pint and full PHPUnit pass on the current working tree: `117 tests / 1043 assertions`.
- Admin `check:all` and `build:analyze` pass after the Reconciliation, Transaction Detail and Notification owner split. Fresh initial closure is `293.1 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS`, under the initial budget.
- Admin route closures remain over budget; the largest measured lazy route is `ReconciliationExportWorkspace.jsx` at `1389.8 KB JS`. This is accepted as route-level debt, not an initial-load blocker.
- MBN ownership, lint and `build:analyze` pass after route-owned CSS and Sass manifest cleanup. Fresh initial closure is `448.8 KB JS / 191.3 KB CSS`; CSS improved from the previous `269.7 KB` but remains the next frontend debt.
- `src/styles/pages/content-route.css` was removed in favor of the Sass owner `content-route.scss`; maintainability now ignores deleted tracked files while the deletion is staged.
- Browser, transactional E2E, DOCX visual render and hash-finalized release summary remain pending until the next clean committed/pushed `release:all` cycle.

## 2026-08-05 source-finalization review

Current source adds semantic control/presentation owners for Admin BaseForm, BaseFilter, BaseTable and Reconciliation export progress, plus an MBN global-style boundary guard. Recovery, package, source-closure, renderer, runtime, maintainability and owner guards pass in source-clean package mode.

Fresh local verification on 2026-08-05 passed API PHPUnit/Pint/package guards, Admin `check:all` plus `build:analyze`, and MBN ownership/lint plus `build:analyze`. Admin initial closure is `293.5 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS`; MBN initial closure is `448.8 KB JS / 177.5 KB CSS`. Browser visual regression, transactional E2E, `release:all`, commit/upstream verification and hash-finalized evidence remain pending for this source.

## 2026-08-05 evidence correction

- The earlier `293.1 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS` Admin and `448.8 KB JS / 191.3 KB CSS` MBN values are historical measurements from the previous route/CSS split.
- Fresh local checks on the current source pass with Admin `293.5 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS` and MBN `448.8 KB JS / 177.5 KB CSS`.
- DOCX source preview passed through LibreOffice PDF conversion and QuickLook PNG preview for API, Admin and MBN. This is recorded separately from the hash-matched `release:all` DOCX gate, which remains pending until a clean pushed release run.
- Frontend verification ran on Node `v26.5.0`; release machines must use Node `>=22.22.0` or another version satisfying `react-router@8.3.0` engines.
### 2026-08-05 source change after 0040 evidence

The route/CSS ownership changes in the next source package invalidate the 0040 bundle and browser measurements as current release evidence. Keep those figures as historical only. Current-source lint/build/browser/E2E/release evidence remains pending until rerun on clean committed and pushed Git HEADs.

## 2026-08-05 current-source verification after new tasks

- API release-package, recovery-baseline and maintainability guards pass after cleaning PHPUnit cache and generated test media. Full PHPUnit/Pint on this source passed earlier in the same verification cycle with `117 tests / 1043 assertions`.
- Admin `format`, `check:all` and `build:analyze` pass after splitting Transaction Command Center presentation/workflow/pending-payment owners. Fresh initial closure is `294.0 KB JS / 25.6 KB CSS`, still under the initial budget.
- Admin route closure debt remains real: 44 lazy-route closures exceed the `650 KB` route budget, led by Disputes, Reconciliation Export, Products, Notifications and Operations queues. This is not an initial-load blocker, but it remains the next route-owner optimization target.
- MBN ownership guards, lint and `build:analyze` pass after moving modal and purchase-modal CSS out of global manifests into component owners. Fresh initial closure is `448.8 KB JS / 160.4 KB CSS`.
- Browser visual regression, transactional E2E, `release:all`, commit/upstream verification and hash-finalized evidence remain pending until a clean pushed release cycle reruns them.

## 2026-08-05 API source-clean storage guard

- API source-clean package guard now fails on runtime files under `storage/logs`, `storage/app/public`, `storage/framework/testing` and `storage/app/backups`, except `.gitignore` placeholders.
- Existing runtime logs, uploaded marketplace media and generated test files were removed from source-clean state before repackaging.
- API release-package, recovery-baseline and maintainability guards pass after the storage cleanup.

## 2026-08-05 MBN responsive shell and CSS ownership recheck

- MBN now keeps one deterministic stylesheet manifest and no route/component side-effect CSS imports. `npm run audit:styles` reports `0` direct CSS imports from `src/components` and `src/pages`.
- Desktop sidebar right-edge compression was traced to stable scrollbar gutter ownership on the sidebar stack. The canonical shell owner now uses border-box geometry and disables reserved scrollbar gutter on the fixed desktop sidebar/navigation viewport.
- Browser DOM metrics at `1920x1200` confirm the sidebar remains `284px` wide and the navigation content/link width resolves to `255px`, matching the sidebar inner width after `14px` left/right padding.
- The current CSS architecture is still debt-heavy: `109` style files, `5` closure/regression-named owners and `33` files with legacy version tokens. These are accepted as staged consolidation debt, not a merge blocker, because manifest ownership, global style boundary, lint and production build pass.
- Root-level temporary MBN closure notes and generated screenshot artifacts were folded into this release follow-up and removed from source-clean state. Canonical long-lived follow-up remains in `docs/canonical/NEXT-BACKLOG.md`.

## 2026-08-05 MBN semantic CSS owner cleanup

- Temporary CSS owner file names were renamed to semantic owners, including desktop shell, mobile shell, mobile visual, mobile density, mobile document/catalog and responsive shell ownership.
- Runtime class names such as `profile-page-v*` and `wallet-summary-strip--v*` were replaced by semantic class names.
- Versioned design tokens such as `--mbn-v45-*`, `--mbn-v54-*`, `--mbn-v55-*` and `--mbn-v62-*` were moved to semantic token names in active stylesheet rules.
- `npm run audit:styles` is now part of `check:ownership` and fails if route/component CSS imports, temporary owner file names or versioned CSS/class tokens return.
- Current strict audit reports `109` style files, `0` temporary owner files, `0` version-token files and `0` direct CSS imports. Lint, UI shell owners, ownership and production build pass after the cleanup.

## 2026-08-05 MBN live banner and safety notice pass

- MBN now uses the restored `https://www.muabannick.pro/` visual assets as temporary remote banner sources through a single catalog asset manifest. Game/service cards use role-specific images for Ninja School, Ngoc Rong, Avatar, Lien Quan Mobile, intermediary transactions, Ninja coin and Carrot instead of reusing one generic banner.
- The home banner height was adjusted through the home/page-surface style owners so the live GIF banner has more vertical room without changing the shared shell layout.
- Product demo images exposed by the API now provide at least three images per fixture product so the MBN detail gallery can demonstrate the slider state.
- The safety notice is mounted once at app-layout level, auto-opens by default, supports "hide for 2 hours" through local storage and remains manually available from the account/sidebar navigation.
- Browser checks confirmed the Lien Quan Mobile card is present, the bank top-up card is no longer shown as a game/service card, remote images do not break, detail gallery shows `1/3`, and the safety notice snooze/menu flow works.

## 2026-08-05 escrow box correction pass

- Escrow Box UI keeps the private alias-only flow and deterministic stylesheet ownership while adding route pages, hooks and repository methods for create, join, terms update, handover, receipt confirmation and dispute opening.
- `EscrowBoxTermsPage` was expanded from compressed JSX into maintainable BaseForm sections and the parser regression was fixed.
- MBN lint, production build, release package, recovery baseline, ownership and digital-asset escrow guards pass on the current source.
- Runtime browser/release evidence remains pending until the next clean pushed release cycle.

## 2026-08-05 184710 style-baseline carry-forward

- The MBN 184710 deterministic stylesheet manifest, desktop/mobile shell owners, and style architecture guards are retained as the active UI baseline.
- Escrow Box routes, hooks, repositories, privacy contract, and media/handover flows are carried forward onto that baseline.
- Escrow Box CSS is registered once in `src/index.css`; route components do not side-effect import CSS.
- API/Admin Escrow Box owners remain `mini_bounded`; no company, RBAC, HR, accounting, report, or project runtime is introduced.
- Previous build/browser/release evidence is stale after this merge and must be regenerated from clean pushed Git HEADs.

### 2026-08-06 — Admin-assigned Escrow Box

- Admin can create a box, select two active customers, and receive two separate customer-bound acceptance links.
- Both parties must accept the same agreement version before Admin review starts.
- Third parties cannot preview or accept a leaked link.
- Admin can rotate links only for parties that have not accepted.
- Runtime lint/build/Pint/PHPUnit/browser/E2E evidence must be regenerated after this source change.


## 2026-08-06 Escrow Box ownership and recovery closure

- Nút tạo Box nằm trong trang danh sách Box; menu riêng tạo Box đã được loại khỏi MBN.
- Trang chi tiết hiển thị lịch sử, trạng thái điều khoản, nghĩa vụ thanh toán và checkpoint bàn giao.
- Người tạo không thể mở hoặc nhận link Bên B của chính mình.
- Người tạo có thể xoay link trước khi Bên B tham gia; link cũ mất hiệu lực ngay.
- Chỉ người tạo được tự hủy trước xử lý tài chính; Admin có quyền hủy khi chưa có nghĩa vụ đã thanh toán.
- Box đã hủy/từ chối/hết hạn có thể sao chép thành Box mới với link mới.
- Contract 2026-08-06.3; runtime build/test/browser evidence phải chạy lại sau source change.


## Escrow Box lifecycle closure 2026-08-06

- Sửa Rules of Hooks ở `EscrowBoxDetailPage`: mọi hook chạy trước loading/error return.
- Trao đổi ngang không còn gửi/validate `topup_amount`; chỉ giao dịch có bù mới yêu cầu tối thiểu 1.000đ.
- Validation API được map về đúng `FormField` dùng chung của BaseForm.
- Người tạo có thể mời Bên B bằng số điện thoại đã được Bên B chủ động cung cấp; lời mời xuất hiện trong Box/notification nhưng không lộ danh tính chéo.
- Người tạo được hủy lời mời trước khi Bên B chấp nhận và có thể mời người khác hoặc quay lại dùng link mới.
- Bên B phải chủ động chấp nhận lời mời trước khi Box chuyển sang rà soát điều khoản.
- Contract `2026-08-06.3`; runtime lint/build/Pint/PHPUnit/browser evidence phải chạy lại sau source change.

## 2026-08-06 Escrow Box validation and counterparty lifecycle hardening

- `EscrowBoxDetailPage` now keeps every React hook above loading/error returns; the source guard rejects conditional hook ordering regressions.
- Create and terms-edit flows share `escrowBoxFormModel`, `useBaseForm`, `EscrowBoxAssetFields`, and field-level API error mapping instead of maintaining parallel form state.
- Horizontal exchange payloads omit `topup_amount` and `topup_payer_side`; only `exchange_with_topup` validates a minimum top-up of 1,000 VND.
- `MoneyInput` exposes `aria-invalid` and works with the canonical `FormField` error surface.
- Phone invitations use a dedicated FormRequest, normalize to 9-15 digits, query active customers under row lock, accept local/`84` variants, and never enumerate all customers in PHP.
- Before acceptance, the creator may cancel a mistaken phone invitation; the removed invitee receives a neutral cancellation notification and the Box returns to `awaiting_counterparty` for a replacement invite or a new link.
- After acceptance, participant replacement remains forbidden. Existing payment, wallet, document, handover, dispute, and settlement owners remain unchanged.
- Source/package/recovery/ownership guards pass. Pint, PHPUnit, frontend lint/build, browser regression, transactional E2E, `release:all`, and hash-finalized evidence remain pending rerun on clean Git repositories with dependencies installed.
## 2026-08-06 — Escrow Box candidate resolution and update history

- Lời mời Bên B chuyển sang hai bước: tìm chính xác bằng số điện thoại, xem ứng viên đã che thông tin, sau đó chọn ứng viên mới gửi lời mời.
- Customer API không trả customer id; candidate token được mã hóa, gắn với Box/người tạo và hết hạn sau 10 phút.
- MBN detail có nút tải lại và nút Cập nhật Box; nút Hủy trang cập nhật nằm ngoài form và căn phải.
- Admin detail hiển thị lịch sử từng phiên bản điều khoản, lý do, người cập nhật và snapshot chi tiết.
- Contract nâng lên 2026-08-06.4; runtime/browser evidence phải chạy lại sau source change.

## 2026-08-06 — Escrow Box UI regression closure

- Không hiển thị copy kỹ thuật về độ dài/implementation validation trên customer UI; form chỉ hướng dẫn hành động người dùng.
- Detail phải bọc các `PageSection` trong `PageStack`/owner spacing; card không được dính liền do render trực tiếp dưới `PageShell`.
- Nút hủy/clone là lifecycle action độc lập, `type=button`, nằm ngoài mọi form và căn phải trong action bar riêng.
- Admin lịch sử điều khoản và sự kiện dùng Timeline owner theo pattern AXIRO Cha, có actor, thời gian và snapshot mở rộng; không quay lại bảng lịch sử ghép ô.
- Static guards khóa cả bốn regression trên để tránh tái diễn.

### 2026-08-06 — Escrow Box update action placement

- MBN detail đặt nút `Cập nhật` cạnh `Hủy box` trong lifecycle action bar; cả hai nằm ngoài form.
- Route cập nhật riêng `/account/escrow-boxes/:id/edit` tiếp tục dùng `EscrowBoxTermsPage` và BaseForm owners.
- Source/static guard đã cập nhật; lint/build/browser evidence phải chạy lại sau source change này.
- Escrow Box update UX closure: action label is now `Cập nhật`; `Hủy` and `Cập nhật` share one right-aligned action row outside the form on desktop, with an intentional two-column mobile layout. Static guards prevent the old `Lưu phiên bản mới` label and accidental line breaks from returning.

### 2026-08-06 — Escrow Box mutation feedback

- Source closure: create success hiển thị toast rồi chuyển đến Detail; update success hiển thị toast và ở lại edit page.
- Detail nhận one-time invite path qua navigation state; raw token không được ghi vào persistent store.
- MBN Escrow Box guard, recovery baseline, release-package, style/semantic owner checks đã PASS trong source-clean audit.
- Frontend lint/build/browser và full API runtime suite vẫn cần chạy lại trên Git HEAD có dependencies; không tái sử dụng evidence trước source change.

## Parent activity/timeline alignment — 2026-08-06

- Reviewed against `axiro-admin-develop-reviewed-source-clean-20260806-181500.zip` and `axiro-api-develop-reviewed-source-clean-20260806-181500.zip`.
- Escrow Box now exposes the same normalized activity keys as AXIRO Cha and Admin uses shared `BaseTimeline` plus a module schema instead of a separate AntD Timeline/table owner.
- The Mini adapter remains bounded: `EscrowBoxEvent` is retained as the domain store and customer actors remain masked as Bên A/B/Nền tảng.
- Existing build/browser/release evidence is stale after this source change; rerun runtime gates from clean Git HEADs.

## 2026-08-06 — Parent Activity Timeline runtime closure

- `useTimeline` dùng nguyên source AXIRO Cha; `BaseTimeline`, `TimelineChangeItem` và CSS là bounded adapter do AXIRO Mini không mang Tailwind/company/RBAC runtime.
- Contract `2026-08-06.6` / API `v70` khai báo rõ cả hai endpoint timeline Escrow Box cho Admin và Customer.
- Backend timeline lọc và phân trang tại SQL boundary, chỉ tải actor và agreement version cần cho trang hiện tại; cấm tải toàn bộ event collection rồi phân trang trong PHP.
- Customer timeline tiếp tục che actor thành Bên A/B/Nền tảng và không trả customer id hoặc tên đối tác.
- `terms_updated` trả old/new đã qua `AuditPayloadSanitizer`; filter `activity_type` và `activity_subtype` được khóa bằng test.
- Static/source/package gates đã chạy lại; Pint, PHPUnit, frontend lint/build, browser và release evidence phải chạy lại trên Git HEAD có dependency đầy đủ.

## 2026-08-06 — Source package cache closure

- API source package đã loại `bootstrap/cache/packages.php` và `bootstrap/cache/services.php`; đây là Composer/Laravel generated cache, không phải source.
- `check-release-package.php` và `check-recovery-baseline.php` hiện fail-closed với mọi file trong `bootstrap/cache/**` ngoại trừ `.gitignore`.
- Regression probe đã xác nhận cả hai checker đều fail khi cố tình thêm lại generated cache.

### 2026-08-06 — BaseForm/PHPUnit/dependency integrity correction

- Đã sửa lỗi hệ thống ở Admin: `BaseFormControl` trước đây làm rơi controlled props được `Form.Item` inject, dẫn đến field nhìn như đã nhập nhưng form state vẫn rỗng và validation tiếp tục báo bắt buộc.
- Đã chuyển `AuditPayloadSanitizerTest` từ Pest DSL sang PHPUnit class và thêm guard cấm Pest DSL trong project PHPUnit-only.
- Đã thêm MBN dependency doctor để chẩn đoán `node_modules` bị cài thiếu/hỏng. Cần dừng Vite và cài sạch dependencies khi thiếu file nội bộ của Vite, React DOM hoặc Ant Design.
- Full lint/build/PHPUnit vẫn cần chạy trên máy local sau khi dependencies được cài sạch.

## 2026-08-06 Parent BaseForm synchronization

Admin BaseForm was synchronized with the reviewed AXIRO parent source. MBN runtime and customer Escrow Box behavior are unchanged in this round; MBN package remains synchronized for three-repository delivery.

### 2026-08-07 — Parent BaseForm consumer/runtime correction

- Sửa toàn bộ `BaseForm.useForm()` thành parent-style `Form.useForm()`; `BaseForm` không có và không được giả lập static `useForm` compatibility API.
- Loại `initialValues` khỏi mọi `BaseForm` consumer vì parent owner không hỗ trợ prop này; default data dùng `record`/field `defaultValue`.
- Base ownership guard được cập nhật để phân biệt AntD `Form.useForm()` hợp lệ với raw AntD Form rendering bị cấm trong Mini.
- Sửa deprecated `Statistic.valueStyle` sang `styles.content`.
- EscrowBox request validation unit path dùng direct FormRequest construction, không resolve FormRequest từ container trong `Validator::make` test.
- Static/recovery/package gates được chạy lại; full frontend build/lint và PHPUnit/Pint vẫn phải xác nhận trên working tree có dependencies.

## 2026-08-07 — Parent Admin layout/table/list synchronization

- Admin sidebar now attaches the AXIRO parent `admin-menu` scroll owner directly to AntD Menu so only the menu region scrolls inside the fixed-height sider.
- `BaseTable` now follows the parent horizontal-overflow contract: AntD Table is the single scroll owner, `scroll.x` defaults to `max-content`, vertical body scrolling is disabled, and the exact parent `columnNormalizer` releases fixed columns on constrained/mobile layouts.
- Desktop row action columns are explicitly `fixed: right`; the responsive normalizer removes those fixed columns on mobile unless a column opts into `isMobileFixed`.
- All canonical List pages delegate list shell/card/table ownership to `BaseListView`; shared page roots use `app-section-stack` so Cards/sections do not visually stick together.
- Dashboard, Action Center, Audit statistics, Operations Control metrics and Wallet summary use `BaseCardStatistics` instead of page-local Card/Statistic grids where the parent base owner already covers the presentation.
- Product offer tags use stable primitive React keys; `BaseReviewActionModal` keeps its `Form.useForm()` instance connected on every render to close AntD warnings.
- Parent `responsive.css` and `columnNormalizer.js` are exact-source owners; `BaseTable` remains a bounded adapter only for Mini pagination/empty-state behavior.
- Static parent/base/layout/package guards pass. Prettier/ESLint/build/browser evidence must be regenerated after installing frontend dependencies.
